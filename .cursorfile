# UI Guidelines and Best Practices

## Responsive Design
- Implement responsive layouts using Tailwind's breakpoint system
- Test across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use fluid typography and spacing
- Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile

## Design System
- Use shadcn/ui components as the primary component library
- Follow Tailwind CSS class naming conventions
- Maintain consistent color palette defined in tailwind.config.js
- Use CSS variables for theme values

## Color Scheme and Typography
- Define a consistent type scale using Tailwind's typography plugin
- Use semantic color names in the theme configuration
- Implement both light and dark mode color schemes
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliant color contrast ratios

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Provide focus indicators
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include alt text for images

## Layout and Spacing
- Use Tailwind's spacing scale consistently
- Implement proper vertical rhythm
- Maintain consistent component spacing
- Use appropriate padding and margins for readability

## Component Guidelines
- Prefer shadcn/ui components when available
- Maintain consistent component APIs
- Document component props and usage
- Include loading states
- Implement error states
- Add hover and focus states

## Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages
